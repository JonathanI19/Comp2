Week 14: Sorting & Complexity (Big O)

## Lab Overview

### Lab 1
In this lab you will write one C++ file and one Python file to do the following tasks:
1. Read a list of integers from a text file
2. Print the average value, accurate to two decimal places
3. Print the square root of the product of the largest two values, accurate to two decimal places

### Lab 2
In this week's lab you will practice writing some straightforward
object-oriented code. You should write the code twice: once in Python
and again in C++

Write a class called "student" that stores a student's name and grades
and can return the maximum and the average grade, as well as display a
student summary. Do not change lab_02.py or lab_02.cpp.


## Project Overview

### Project 1
In this project, you will used C++ to code up a simple game I have invented.
The purpose of the project is to practice using classes and objects.
The game consists of `players`. Multiple players can be grouped into `teams`
and two `teams` can play each other. You can make the coding easier by starting
by building and testing `player` before moving on to `team` and then `competition`.

PROVIDED: 

**play_game.cpp** was provided as a complete file

**Makefile** was provided - links to file in server that contains code for **int generate_score(int)**, which is not included in the GitHub.
