## Lab Overview

### Lab 1
In this lab you will write one C++ file and one Python file to do the following tasks:
1. Read a list of integers from a text file
2. Print the average value, accurate to two decimal places
3. Print the square root of the product of the largest two values, accurate to two decimal places

### Lab 2
In this week's lab you will practice writing some straightforward
object-oriented code. You should write the code twice: once in Python
and again in C++

Write a class called "student" that stores a student's name and grades
and can return the maximum and the average grade, as well as display a
student summary. Do not change lab_02.py or lab_02.cpp.
